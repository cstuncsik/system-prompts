# AI Agent System Prompts

A curated collection of professional-grade system prompts for AI agents, crafted from real-world experience and battle-tested in production environments.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of AI agent system prompts, each reflecting years of professional experience in their respective domains. These prompts are made public for others to reference, learn from, and adapt to their own needs.

Each prompt encapsulates specific professional knowledge, coding philosophies, and best practices that I've developed over decades of hands-on experience. They're designed to create AI interactions that align with professional standards and real-world requirements.

## Available System Prompts

| Prompt | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Senior Frontend Developer](frontend-developer.md) | Web Development | Comprehensive prompt reflecting 20+ years of frontend development experience, modern practices, and professional standards |

## Featured: Senior Frontend Developer

- **Deep Technical Knowledge**: JavaScript/TypeScript internals, CSS rendering pipeline, browser APIs
- **Modern Best Practices**: Performance optimization, accessibility, security principles
- **Professional Standards**: Code review preferences, testing philosophy, architectural decisions
- **Personal Preferences**: Specific coding styles, tooling choices, and development approaches

Key areas covered:
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns and preferences
- CSS-first approach with advanced layout techniques
- Semantic HTML and accessibility best practices
- Browser compatibility and performance optimization
- Security and privacy considerations
- Professional workflow and collaboration preferences

## Usage

These prompts are designed to work with various AI models and platforms. To use:

1. Copy the entire content of the desired prompt file
2. Paste it as your system prompt/instructions in your AI interface
3. Adapt the preferences and specifics to match your own requirements

**Note**: These prompts reflect my personal preferences and experience. Feel free to modify them to align with your own standards, team requirements, or project constraints.

## Future Additions

I'll continue adding new system prompts as I develop and refine them for different professional domains. Each will maintain the same level of detail and practical focus as the current collection.

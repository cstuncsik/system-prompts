# AI Agent System Prompts & Guides

A curated collection of professional-grade system prompts and comprehensive guides for AI agents, crafted from real-world experience and battle-tested in production environments.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of AI agent system prompts and development guides, each reflecting years of professional experience in their respective domains. These are made public for others to reference, learn from, and adapt to their own needs.

Each resource encapsulates specific professional knowledge, coding philosophies, and best practices that I've developed over decades of hands-on experience. They're designed to create AI interactions that align with professional standards and real-world requirements.

## Resource Types

### **System Prompts**
- **Behavioral instructions** - Tell AI agents WHO to be and HOW to behave
- **Focused expertise** - Concise professional personas without tutorials
- **Production-ready** - Optimized for AI agent configuration
- **Best for**: Daily AI agent usage, token efficiency, direct AI instruction

### **Comprehensive Guides**
- **Educational content** - Complete explanations with detailed code examples
- **Decision frameworks** - Understand the "why" behind architectural decisions
- **Real-world patterns** - Battle-tested examples from production applications
- **Hierarchical knowledge** - Advanced guides build on foundational guides (e.g., Vue 3 Testing Guide extends all three: Frontend, Vue 3, and Testing guides)
- **Best for**: Learning, mentoring, reference documentation, understanding philosophy

## Usage

These resources are designed to work with various AI models and platforms. You have **three ways** to use them:

### **Option 1: System Prompts (Token-Efficient)**
Use the main prompt files for efficient AI agent configuration:
1. Copy the content from files like `frontend-developer.md`, `testing-developer.md`
2. Paste as your system prompt/instructions in your AI interface
3. **Best for**: Daily usage, token-conscious applications, fast AI responses

### **Option 2: Guides as Learning Material**
Use the guide files for education and reference:
1. Read through files like `frontend-developer-guide.md`, `vue3-developer-guide.md`
2. Study the code examples and decision frameworks
3. **Best for**: Learning, mentoring, understanding development philosophy

### **Option 3: Guides as Comprehensive System Prompts**
Use the complete guide files as detailed system prompts:
1. Copy the entire content from any `-guide.md` file
2. Paste as your system prompt for maximum detail and context
3. **Best for**: Users who want all examples/explanations and don't mind token usage

**Note**: These resources reflect my personal preferences and experience. Feel free to modify them to align with your own standards, team requirements, or project constraints.

## Future Additions

I'll continue adding new system prompts as I develop and refine them for different professional domains. Each will maintain the same level of detail and practical focus as the current collection.
